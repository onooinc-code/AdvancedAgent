# Feature: Conversation Search

## 1. Objective
To allow users to quickly and easily find past conversations by searching for keywords or phrases within both the conversation titles and message content.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. UI Implementation
- A search input field shall be added to the top of the conversation list sidebar.
- As the user types into the search bar, the conversation list should be filtered in real-time.

### 2.2. Search Logic
- The search functionality will be client-side, filtering the existing `conversations` array from the state.
- The filter logic should be case-insensitive.
- A conversation should be included in the search results if the search term is found in:
  - The conversation's `title`.
  - The `text` property of any `message` within that conversation.

### 2.3. State Management
- A new piece of state (e.g., `searchQuery`) will be added to manage the content of the search bar.
- The component rendering the conversation list will derive the filtered list based on the `conversations` array and the `searchQuery`. No modification to the master `conversations` array is needed.
