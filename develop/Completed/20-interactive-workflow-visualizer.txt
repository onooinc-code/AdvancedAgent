# Feature: Interactive Workflow Visualizer

## 1. Objective
To provide users with a clear, graphical representation of the AI's decision-making and response process for each turn, enhancing transparency and understanding.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Visualization Trigger
- An icon or button will be added to each user message bubble (or the space after it).
- Clicking this button will open a modal or an inline-expanding panel that displays the workflow for the response to that specific prompt.

### 2.2. Flowchart/Timeline Display
- The visualizer will render a simple flowchart or timeline.
- **Nodes in the flowchart could include:**
  - "User Prompt" (showing the text)
  - "Manager Decision" (showing which agent was selected and why, if applicable)
  - "Agent Response" (one node for each agent that responded in the turn)
- Lines will connect the nodes to show the sequence of events.

### 2.3. Data Integration
- The visualizer will use the `pipeline` data already attached to AI message objects.
- It will parse this data to construct the nodes and connections, displaying the inputs and outputs for each step in a readable format.
