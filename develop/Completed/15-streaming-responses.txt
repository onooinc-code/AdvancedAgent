# Feature: Streaming AI Responses

## 1. Objective
To improve the user experience and perceived performance of the application by displaying AI-generated responses token by token, rather than waiting for the full response to be complete.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Service Layer Integration
- The `agentService` shall be updated to use the `ai.models.generateContentStream` method from the Gemini API instead of `generateContent`.
- The service function will need to be adapted to handle the asynchronous stream of `GenerateContentResponse` chunks.

### 2.2. State Management
- The `useChatHandler` hook must be modified to handle streaming data.
- When a stream begins, a new, empty AI message bubble should be added to the state.
- As each chunk of text arrives from the stream, it should be appended to the `text` property of that message object, triggering a re-render.

### 2.3. User Interface
- The UI should smoothly render the incoming text into the message bubble.
- A blinking cursor or similar visual indicator should be present at the end of the streaming text to indicate that content is still being generated.
- The message input and other actions should remain disabled until the stream is fully complete.
