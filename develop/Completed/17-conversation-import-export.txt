# Feature: Conversation Import/Export

## 1. Objective
To provide users with the ability to back up their conversations to a local file and restore them later, ensuring data portability and peace of mind.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Export Functionality
- An "Export All Conversations" button will be added to the main Settings modal.
- Clicking this button will serialize the entire `conversations` array from local storage into a JSON string.
- The application will then trigger a browser download of this data as a `.json` file (e.g., `ai-assistant-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`).

### 2.2. Import Functionality
- An "Import Conversations" button will be added to the main Settings modal, next to an HTML file input element.
- When the user selects a JSON file, the application will read and parse it.
- The application must validate that the parsed object is an array of `Conversation` objects that match the application's data structure.
- Upon successful validation, the imported conversations will be merged with the existing conversations. A simple merging strategy would be to prepend the imported conversations to the existing list, ensuring no local data is overwritten. Duplicate conversations (by ID) could be ignored.

### 2.3. User Feedback
- The UI should provide clear feedback to the user upon successful import or if an error occurs (e.g., invalid file format).
