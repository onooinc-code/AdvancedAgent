# Feature: Manager Insights Overlay

## 1. Objective
To provide users with optional, real-time commentary from the AI Manager, offering transparency into its decision-making process during a conversation.

## 2. Core Functionality

### 2.1. Feature Toggle
- A new setting, "Show Manager Insights," will be added to the `Conversation Settings` modal.
- This toggle will allow users to enable or disable the insights on a per-conversation basis.

### 2.2. Insight Display
- When enabled, the manager's `rationale` for its decisions will be posted directly into the chat as a distinct system message.
- This applies to both "Dynamic" mode (showing the rationale for the overall plan) and "Moderated Chat" mode (showing the rationale for each turn's decision).

### 2.3. UI/UX
- Insight messages will be visually distinct from regular agent or user messages.
- They will be clearly labeled (e.g., "Manager Insight") and may have a unique icon or color scheme to differentiate them.
