# QA Report: Feature 16 - Conversation Search

**Feature Description:** Add a search input to the sidebar to filter conversations by title and message content in real-time.

### **Part 1: Static Analysis & Risk Assessment**

*   **File & Function/Component:** `components/ConversationList.tsx` -> `filteredConversations` (`useMemo` hook)
    *   **Purpose:** To efficiently filter the master list of conversations based on the user's search query without modifying the original data.
    *   **Analysis of Changes:** This is the core logic of the feature. It uses `useMemo` to prevent re-computation on every render. The filtering logic is case-insensitive and iterates through both the conversation `title` and all `messages`' text.
    *   **Predicted Behavior & Outputs:**
        *   **On Success:** Returns a new array containing only the `Conversation` objects that match the search query. If the query is empty, it returns the original, unfiltered `conversations` array.
        *   **On Failure:** The logic is self-contained and primarily involves string manipulation. The only potential failure point is if `conv.messages` is not an array, but this would be a larger data integrity issue, not a bug in this specific logic.
    *   **Identified Risks & Checklist Violations:**
        *   **Risk (Performance):** For a conversation with thousands of messages, the `messages.some(...)` loop could become slow. However, for a typical number of messages, client-side filtering is acceptable. The use of `useMemo` is a correct and effective mitigation for unnecessary re-renders. No checklist violations.

*   **File & Function/Component:** `components/ConversationList.tsx` -> Render Logic
    *   **Purpose:** To display the search bar and the correctly filtered list of conversations.
    *   **Analysis of Changes:** An `<input>` element has been added. The `.map()` function now iterates over `filteredConversations` instead of `conversations`. The empty-state message is now conditional based on whether a search is active.
    *   **Predicted Behavior & Outputs:**
        *   **On Success:** The UI correctly reflects the filtered results. When no results are found during a search, it displays "No matching conversations found." When the list is empty and there's no search, it displays "No chats yet."
    *   **Identified Risks & Checklist Violations:**
        *   **Checklist Item 3.2 (Component Completeness):** The component correctly handles multiple states: the normal list, a filtered list, an empty list with no search, and an empty list due to a search. This is a complete implementation.

### **Part 2: Unit & Integration Test Scenarios (Gherkin Syntax)**

**Scenario: Search query matches a conversation title**
*   **Given:** A list of three conversations with titles "React Project", "Shopping List", and "Meeting Notes".
*   **And:** The user types "project" into the search input.
*   **When:** The `filteredConversations` array is computed.
*   **Then:** The array should contain exactly one conversation: the one titled "React Project".

**Scenario: Search query matches message content**
*   **Given:** A conversation titled "Ideas" contains a message with the text "We should use a client-side database.". Another conversation has no such message.
*   **And:** The user types "database" into the search input.
*   **When:** The `filteredConversations` array is computed.
*   **Then:** The array should contain the conversation titled "Ideas".

**Scenario: Search query is case-insensitive**
*   **Given:** A conversation is titled "Vacation Plans".
*   **And:** The user types "vAcAtIoN" into the search input.
*   **When:** The `filteredConversations` array is computed.
*   **Then:** The array should contain the conversation titled "Vacation Plans".

**Scenario: Empty search query shows all conversations**
*   **Given:** A list of five conversations.
*   **And:** The user types "test" and then deletes it, making the search input empty.
*   **When:** The `filteredConversations` array is computed.
*   **Then:** The array should contain all five original conversations.

**Scenario: No matching conversations are found**
*   **Given:** A list of conversations, none of which contain the word "xyz".
*   **And:** The user types "xyz" into the search input.
*   **When:** The component renders.
*   **Then:** The conversation list area should display the text "No matching conversations found.".

### **Part 3: End-to-End (E2E) Manual Test Plan**

**Test Case 1: Search by title**
*   **Objective:** Verify that filtering by conversation title works correctly.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create two conversations and rename them to "Alpha Test" and "Beta Test".
    2.  In the search bar in the sidebar, type "Alpha".
*   **Expected Result:** The conversation list should instantly update to show only the "Alpha Test" conversation. The "Beta Test" conversation should be hidden.

**Test Case 2: Search by message content**
*   **Objective:** Verify that filtering by the content of messages works correctly.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Create a new chat. Send the message "My favorite color is blue."
    2.  Create a second new chat. Send the message "My favorite animal is a dog."
    3.  In the search bar, type "blue".
*   **Expected Result:** The list should filter to show only the first conversation.

**Test Case 3: Clearing the search restores the full list**
*   **Objective:** Ensure the full conversation list is shown after clearing the search query.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Perform a search that yields results (e.g., "blue" from the previous test case).
    2.  Click into the search bar and delete all the text.
*   **Expected Result:** As soon as the search bar is empty, the full list of all conversations should reappear.

**Test Case 4: Search with no results**
*   **Objective:** Verify the UI displays a helpful message when no conversations match the search.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  In the search bar, type a random string that does not exist in any title or message (e.g., "qwertyzxcvb").
*   **Expected Result:** The conversation list area should become empty and display the message: "No matching conversations found."
