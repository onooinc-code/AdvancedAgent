# QA Report: Feature 02 - Conversation Titling

**Feature Description:** Allow users to easily identify conversations through clear, editable titles, with an AI-assisted option for convenience.

---

### **Part 1: Static Analysis & Risk Assessment**

*   **File & Function/Component:** `services/titleService.ts` -> `generateConversationTitle()`
    *   **Purpose:** Calls the Gemini API to generate a short title for a conversation.
    *   **Analysis of Changes:** This is the core AI logic for the feature.
    *   **Predicted Behavior & Outputs:**
        *   **On Success:** Returns a promise that resolves to a string (the title). The code includes logic to trim whitespace and remove surrounding quotes.
        *   **On Failure:** The `try...catch` block catches API errors, logs them, and returns a generic fallback title ("Chat").
    *   **Identified Risks & Checklist Violations:**
        *   **Risk:** The API call is the main point of failure. The graceful fallback prevents a crash. No checklist violations. The error handling is good.

*   **File & Function/Component:** `contexts/hooks/useConversationManager.ts` -> `handleGenerateTitle()`
    *   **Purpose:** Manages the state and orchestrates the AI title generation process.
    *   **Analysis of Changes:** Wires the UI action to the title service.
    *   **Predicted Behavior & Outputs:**
        *   **On Success:** Sets `isGeneratingTitle` to `true` on the conversation object, calls the service, updates the conversation's title with the result, and sets `isGeneratingTitle` back to `false`.
        *   **On Failure:** The `finally` block ensures `isGeneratingTitle` is always set back to `false`, preventing the UI from getting stuck in a loading state. This is a robust implementation.
    *   **Identified Risks & Checklist Violations:**
        *   **Risk:** A race condition could occur if the user navigates away while a title is being generated. The current implementation would still update the title of the (now inactive) conversation, which is acceptable behavior. No checklist violations.

*   **File & Function/Component:** `components/Header.tsx`
    *   **Purpose:** Displays the title and provides UI for manual editing and AI generation.
    *   **Analysis of Changes:** Contains the input field for editing and the "sparkles" button.
    *   **Predicted Behavior & Outputs:**
        *   **On Success:** Toggles between a text display and an input field. The input correctly handles `onKeyDown` for Enter/Escape and `onBlur` events. The AI button is disabled when `isGeneratingTitle` is true, showing a spinner.
        *   **On Failure:** n/a
    *   **Identified Risks & Checklist Violations:**
        *   **Checklist Item:** 3.2 (Component Completeness). The component correctly handles the loading state (`isGeneratingTitle`) by showing a spinner and disabling the button. This is good practice.

### **Part 2: Unit & Integration Test Scenarios (Gherkin Syntax)**

**Scenario: AI title generation succeeds**
*   **Given:** The `handleGenerateTitle` function is called for a conversation.
*   **And:** The `TitleService.generateConversationTitle` is mocked to return `"AI Generated Title"`.
*   **When:** The function is executed.
*   **Then:** The conversation's `isGeneratingTitle` property should be set to `true`, then `false`.
*   **And:** The conversation's `title` property should be updated to `"AI Generated Title"`.

**Scenario: AI title generation fails**
*   **Given:** The `handleGenerateTitle` function is called for a conversation.
*   **And:** The `TitleService.generateConversationTitle` is mocked to throw an error.
*   **When:** The function is executed.
*   **Then:** The conversation's `isGeneratingTitle` property should be set to `true`, then `false`.
*   **And:** The conversation's `title` property should remain unchanged.

### **Part 3: End-to-End (E2E) Manual Test Plan**

**Test Case 1: Manually edit a conversation title**
*   **Objective:** Verify a user can rename a conversation by typing.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Select a conversation.
    2.  In the header, click the "Edit" (pencil) icon next to the title.
    3.  The title becomes an input field. Type a new title, e.g., "My Test Title".
    4.  Press the "Enter" key.
*   **Expected Result:** The input field disappears. The header now displays "My Test Title". The conversation's name in the left sidebar is also updated to "My Test Title".

**Test Case 2: Generate a title with AI**
*   **Objective:** Verify the AI title generation works correctly.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Start a new conversation and send a few messages (e.g., "What are the main benefits of React?").
    2.  In the header, click the "Generate title with AI" (sparkles) icon.
*   **Expected Result:** The icon is replaced by a spinner. After a few seconds, the spinner disappears and the conversation title in both the header and sidebar is updated to something relevant (e.g., "React Benefits Discussion").

**Test Case 3: Handle AI title generation failure**
*   **Objective:** Verify the UI does not get stuck if the AI call fails.
*   **Setup:** Use browser developer tools to block network requests to `generativelanguage.googleapis.com`.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  With network requests blocked, click the "Generate title with AI" icon.
*   **Expected Result:** The icon changes to a spinner for a moment, then reverts back to the sparkles icon. The title does not change. The application remains responsive.
